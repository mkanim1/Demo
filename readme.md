## INF 308: Programming for Informatics
--------------

This is your individual repository. More than half the class will not have
used their real name for their github login. That's pretty normal. I only
use my real name to get the free private repositories for students. But
I won't know your github handle and I need to associate it with you. Replace
this text with some personal details:

1. The name you are registered under
2. The name you prefer to be called if it's not the same as the name you
are registered under
3. Your preferred pronouns.
4. Anything else you think you should share related to this.

Example:
1. Cristyn Magnus
2. Cristyn, Cris, C, 
3. She/her/hers or they/their/theirs
4. If you like being formal, you can call me Dr. Magnus. Some students 
call me Magnus and I'm good with that. I'm from California and we don't 
do extreme formality but I know some students are uncomfortable without it. 
Please do NOT call me Mrs. or Ms. Magnus. If you don't think titles are
important, don't use one. If you think they are important and deliberately
use the wrong one, that's problematic.
