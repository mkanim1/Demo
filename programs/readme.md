## Programming
---

All of the programs you write for this class should live in this directory or in sensibly labeled subdirectories. Some guidelines:

 * Any program that consists of a single file should be clearly named and put in this directory.
 * For any program that consists of multiple files, all files should be placed in a clearly labeled subdirectory.
 * Programs should not be duplicated unless you are explicitly instructed to do so. As a rule, different versions should be accessible primarily through git, not through clutter.
 

### Programs Must Run (aka you should work in a development branch)

It is standard in programming classes to give a 0 to all programs that don't run. Working on your programs gives you programming progress credit. But completing your programs is required for your programming grade. Your programs must run. They don't have to be perfect, but they do have to run. It is a good idea to work in a development branch and merge programs to your main branch once they are done. This means the instructor won't grade programs you don't think are done yet. It also means that if something goes wrong adding a feature and you can't debug it, you can backtrack to a working version and only merge that one into the main branch.
