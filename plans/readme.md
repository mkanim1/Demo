## Plans

This directory contains your project management plans.

If you use a text-based planning system, you can just keep your plan here. If you use another system, please put your plan in pdf format. If you use a spreadsheet, save it as a pdf. If you use paper, scan it and save that as a pdf. If you use some other program that doesn't directly make PDFs, take a screenshot. You can convert a screenshot to pdf by printing it to pdf instead of a printer, or by putting the picture in a document editor and saving it as a pdf.
